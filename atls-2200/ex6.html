            <h3>WHO AM I:</h3>
            <p>
                I am a fifth year software development 
                student with with a passion for all 
                things design and creativity.
                <br>
                I tend to excel at the front end of
                the stack but learn quickly, and can
                work anywhere.
                <br>
                I spend my free time learning all
                kinds of new tools, be they code,
                3D modeling, animation, game de-
                sign, visual effects, or otherwise,
                Iâ€™m always hungry to learn something new.

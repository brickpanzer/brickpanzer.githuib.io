                <h2>Challenge 5: Accesibility Statement</h2><br>
                <p>
                    One thing I can see that could be a concern for accesibility would be the fact that radio labels are placed after the input itself, meaning that a screen reader could potentially get confused as to the order of inpust on the screen.
                    Alternatively, I could actually see items like dynamic navigations bars like the ugly one i added to my index being actually MORE accessible, as they would be displayed all at once to people with a screen reader.
                    Of course, this is potentially a positive or negative depending on the use case, as it could be seen as something that obfuscates the efficiency that someone with a screen reader could navigate the page, adding potentially
                    unescessary information in their way between them and the content they actually want to see.
